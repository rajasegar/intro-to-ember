            <p>There are <span class="yellow">lot of differences in opinion</span> within the Ember community itself</p>
          </section> 
          <section>
            <p class="yellow">Pain points #1</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Octane removed the ability to use the type attribute and being able to use attributes in component helpers in general
              </li>
              <li>
                weird bugs because of the helper manager thing and others with old two way bindings no longer working
              </li> 
              <li>
                destroyables changed how destroying worked, so you could no longer reliably destroy things in order, it just destroys at "some point" later
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a string to call a component with angle brackets has been removed for future reasons
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p class="yellow">Pain points #2</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The way params work into helpers suddenly changed, they are no longer immutable or something
              </li>
              <li>
                Removed observers (well recommended to) with no real replacement, lead to different types of hacks 
              </li>
              <li>
                Back to attributes, basically useless feature now outside of the basics unless you use modifiers and change the DOM manually
              </li>
              <li>
                Glimmer also made it so any template variable that was the same as a HTML element would be broken... this was not documented 
              </li>

              this dismissal of people's felt needs stems from, <span class="yellow">Ember's history of paternalism. Since Ember 3.x and Octane, Ember's has gotten much less paternalistic</span> as it has started released primitives to unlock work instead of telling people to just wait until Ember figures it out. However, <span class="cyan">the paternalism doesn't seem fully excised and it shows up in subtle ways.</span>

              To really address the problems, Ember needs to take a pretty hard look at the needs Ember isn't meeting and meet them. Sure, regarding the survey, the stats are bad, the representation is terrible, people haven't heard about Octane, etc, etc, etc -- those are all ways of just dismissing the reality: by any modern metric, <span class="yellow">Ember is behind. We don't have production ready code splitting, we're not the fastest (or top tier), we're not the least memory (or top tier).</span> Sure, we have strengths (convention, etc), but shouting our strengths while ignoring the weaknesses doesn't help us address the needs.

              <span class="yellow">If Ember is to ever fight back, it needs to rebrand when, and only when, it's actually delivering some business value that's immediately apparent and people can see for themselves and sell to their bosses.</span> E.g. We're top 10 fastest, smallest bundle size, out of the box SSR, easily integrate other components from React/Vue, etc -- something where people go, "oh, you might not be the most popular but you're solving problems better than other people are"

              <p class="cyan">Merely focusing on our laurels isn't going to help us get there.</p>

            it let people see <span class="yellow">this tool created business value immediately. With Ember, you can't create something of value immediately</span> -- you need to learn this and learn that and put this file and that file there. And then, what do you get? Nothing special that's not as good as anything else. And yes, octane has helped people make "hello world" much faster, but quickly doing "hello world" is just not enough. Now, we have to do more value than hello world.

             <section>

               <span class="yellow">If you want to see an example of a framework immediately solving business problems, check out Next.js -- it solves so many problems for content sites and it's immediately apparent how it delivers that value (small bundle, fast loading, SWR, etc).</span> Ember needs to find values it uniquely solves that don't take building an app with 100+ components to realize you need. If the pitch for ember is "Bet your app on React and then in 3 years, you'll realize you were wrong!", we're not going to win. 
             </section>
             <section>

               <span class="yellow">If I were to build our startup again, no way I'd use Ember -- it doesn't deliver any value that isn't trumped by the MUCH bigger ecosystem of React et al.</span> Ember needs to find that secret sauce. I think it could find it, but I haven't seen any evidence Ember has articulated something that in the next 2 years it will be able to do that will be better than what anyone else can do -- something that will make people risk their company on it.

             <section>
encourage people to put less time into blaming a survey and more time into really unpacking what else we need to do to be a tool worth risking your company on.

<span class="yellow"> the conversation around rebranding is good, but by itself, I don't think it will move the needle (just as the release of Glimmer didn't).</span>
